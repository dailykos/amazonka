--
-- * 'bSecondaryArtifacts' - An array of @ProjectArtifacts@ objects. 
--
-- * 'bArn' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the build.
--
-- * 'bStartTime' - When the build process started, expressed in Unix time format.
--
-- * 'bArtifacts' - Information about the output artifacts for the build.
--
-- * 'bEnvironment' - Information about the build environment for this build.
--
-- * 'bInitiator' - The entity that started the build. Valid values include:     * If AWS CodePipeline started the build, the pipeline's name (for example, @codepipeline/my-demo-pipeline@ ).     * If an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user started the build, the user's name (for example, @MyUserName@ ).     * If the Jenkins plugin for AWS CodeBuild started the build, the string @CodeBuild-Jenkins-Plugin@ .

Each @ProjectSourceVersion@ must be one of:      * For AWS CodeCommit: the commit ID to use.     * For GitHub: the commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the format @pr/pull-request-ID@ (for example, @pr/25@ ). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.     * For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.     * For Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3): the version ID of the object that represents the build input ZIP file to use.
--
-- * 'bCurrentPhase' - The current build phase.
--
-- * 'bQueuedTimeoutInMinutes' - The number of minutes a build is allowed to be queued before it times out.

--
-- * 'bLogs' - Information about the build's logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
--
-- * 'bResolvedSourceVersion' - An identifier for the version of this build's source code.      * For AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, and BitBucket, the commit ID.      * For AWS CodePipeline, the source revision provided by AWS CodePipeline.      * For Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), this does not apply. 
--
-- * 'bVpcConfig' - If your AWS CodeBuild project accesses resources in an Amazon VPC, you provide this parameter that identifies the VPC ID and the list of security group IDs and subnet IDs. The security groups and subnets must belong to the same VPC. You must provide at least one security group and one subnet ID.
--
-- * 'bEndTime' - When the build process ended, expressed in Unix time format.
--
-- * 'bProjectName' - The name of the AWS CodeBuild project.
--
-- * 'bBuildStatus' - The current status of the build. Valid values include:     * @FAILED@ : The build failed.     * @FAULT@ : The build faulted.     * @IN_PROGRESS@ : The build is still in progress.     * @STOPPED@ : The build stopped.     * @SUCCEEDED@ : The build succeeded.     * @TIMED_OUT@ : The build timed out.

This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of AWS CodeBuild.     * If @type@ is set to @NO_ARTIFACTS@ , this value is ignored if specified, because no build output is produced.     * If @type@ is set to @S3@ , valid values include:     * @NONE@ : AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a folder that contains the build output.

If @path@ is not specified, @path@ is not used. For example, if @path@ is set to @MyArtifacts@ , @namespaceType@ is set to @NONE@ , and @name@ is set to @MyArtifact.zip@ , the output artifact is stored in the output bucket at @MyArtifacts/MyArtifact.zip@ .

--
-- * 'paOverrideArtifactName' - If this flag is set, a name specified in the build spec file overrides the artifact name. The name specified in a build spec file is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique.

Set to true only if the build project is be used to build Docker images, and the specified build environment image is not provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support. Otherwise, all associated builds that attempt to interact with the Docker daemon fail. You must also start the Docker daemon so that builds can interact with it. One way to do this is to initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of your build spec by running the following build commands. (Do not run these commands if the specified build environment image is provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support.) If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux: @- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay& - timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"@  If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux, add the @-t@ argument to @timeout@ : @- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay& - timeout 15 -t sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"@

--
-- * 'peType' - The type of build environment to use for related builds.
--

-- | The type of credentials AWS CodeBuild uses to pull images in your build. There are two valid values:      * @CODEBUILD@ specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses its own credentials. This requires that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust AWS CodeBuild's service principal.      * @SERVICE_ROLE@ specifies that AWS CodeBuild uses your build project's service role.  When you use a cross-account or private registry image, you must use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When you use an AWS CodeBuild curated image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials.

-- | Enables running the Docker daemon inside a Docker container. Set to true only if the build project is be used to build Docker images, and the specified build environment image is not provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support. Otherwise, all associated builds that attempt to interact with the Docker daemon fail. You must also start the Docker daemon so that builds can interact with it. One way to do this is to initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of your build spec by running the following build commands. (Do not run these commands if the specified build environment image is provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support.) If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux: @- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay& - timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"@  If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux, add the @-t@ argument to @timeout@ : @- nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay& - timeout 15 -t sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"@
