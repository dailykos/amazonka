-- | Creates a value of 'ListDevices' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ldArn' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project.
--
-- * 'ldFilters' - Used to select a set of devices. A filter is made up of an attribute, an operator, and one or more values.     * Attribute: The aspect of a device such as platform or model used as the selction criteria in a device filter. Allowed values include:     * ARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device. For example, "arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2::device:12345Example".     * PLATFORM: The device platform. Valid values are "ANDROID" or "IOS".     * OS_VERSION: The operating system version. For example, "10.3.2".     * MODEL: The device model. For example, "iPad 5th Gen".     * AVAILABILITY: The current availability of the device. Valid values are "AVAILABLE", "HIGHLY_AVAILABLE", "BUSY", or "TEMPORARY_NOT_AVAILABLE".     * FORM_FACTOR: The device form factor. Valid values are "PHONE" or "TABLET".     * MANUFACTURER: The device manufacturer. For example, "Apple".     * REMOTE_ACCESS_ENABLED: Whether the device is enabled for remote access. Valid values are "TRUE" or "FALSE".     * REMOTE_DEBUG_ENABLED: Whether the device is enabled for remote debugging. Valid values are "TRUE" or "FALSE".     * INSTANCE_ARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device instance.     * INSTANCE_LABELS: The label of the device instance.     * FLEET_TYPE: The fleet type. Valid values are "PUBLIC" or "PRIVATE".     * Operator: The filter operator.     * The EQUALS operator is available for every attribute except INSTANCE_LABELS.     * The CONTAINS operator is available for the INSTANCE_LABELS and MODEL attributes.     * The IN and NOT_IN operators are available for the ARN, OS_VERSION, MODEL, MANUFACTURER, and INSTANCE_ARN attributes.     * The LESS_THAN, GREATER_THAN, LESS_THAN_OR_EQUALS, and GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS operators are also available for the OS_VERSION attribute.     * Values: An array of one or more filter values.     * The IN and NOT_IN operators take a values array that has one or more elements.     * The other operators require an array with a single element.     * In a request, the AVAILABILITY attribute takes "AVAILABLE", "HIGHLY_AVAILABLE", "BUSY", or "TEMPORARY_NOT_AVAILABLE" as values.
--
-- * 'ldNextToken' - An identifier that was returned from the previous call to this operation, which can be used to return the next set of items in the list.
