-- Shares a specified directory (@DirectoryId@ ) in your AWS account (directory owner) with another AWS account (directory consumer). With this operation you can use your directory from any AWS account and from any Amazon VPC within an AWS Region.
--
--
-- When you share your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory, AWS Directory Service creates a shared directory in the directory consumer account. This shared directory contains the metadata to provide access to the directory within the directory owner account. The shared directory is visible in all VPCs in the directory consumer account.
--
-- The @ShareMethod@ parameter determines whether the specified directory can be shared between AWS accounts inside the same AWS organization (@ORGANIZATIONS@ ). It also determines whether you can share the directory with any other AWS account either inside or outside of the organization (@HANDSHAKE@ ).
--
-- The @ShareNotes@ parameter is only used when @HANDSHAKE@ is called, which sends a directory sharing request to the directory consumer.
