-- Deletes a private certificate authority (CA). You must provide the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the private CA that you want to delete. You can find the ARN by calling the 'ListCertificateAuthorities' operation. Before you can delete a CA, you must disable it. Call the 'UpdateCertificateAuthority' operation and set the __CertificateAuthorityStatus__ parameter to @DISABLED@ . 
--
--
-- Additionally, you can delete a CA if you are waiting for it to be created (the __Status__ field of the 'CertificateAuthority' is @CREATING@ ). You can also delete it if the CA has been created but you haven't yet imported the signed certificate (the __Status__ is @PENDING_CERTIFICATE@ ) into ACM PCA. 
--
-- If the CA is in one of the aforementioned states and you call 'DeleteCertificateAuthority' , the CA's status changes to @DELETED@ . However, the CA won't be permentantly deleted until the restoration period has passed. By default, if you do not set the @PermanentDeletionTimeInDays@ parameter, the CA remains restorable for 30 days. You can set the parameter from 7 to 30 days. The 'DescribeCertificateAuthority' operation returns the time remaining in the restoration window of a Private CA in the @DELETED@ state. To restore an eligable CA, call the 'RestoreCertificateAuthority' operation.
