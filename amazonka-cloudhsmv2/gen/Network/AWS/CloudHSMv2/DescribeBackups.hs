-- Gets information about backups of AWS CloudHSM clusters.
--
--
-- This is a paginated operation, which means that each response might contain only a subset of all the backups. When the response contains only a subset of backups, it includes a @NextToken@ value. Use this value in a subsequent @DescribeBackups@ request to get more backups. When you receive a response with no @NextToken@ (or an empty or null value), that means there are no more backups to get.
--
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.

-- | Creates a value of 'DescribeBackups' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dbSortAscending' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'dbFilters' - One or more filters to limit the items returned in the response. Use the @backupIds@ filter to return only the specified backups. Specify backups by their backup identifier (ID). Use the @sourceBackupIds@ filter to return only the backups created from a source backup. The @sourceBackupID@ of a source backup is returned by the 'CopyBackupToRegion' operation. Use the @clusterIds@ filter to return only the backups for the specified clusters. Specify clusters by their cluster identifier (ID). Use the @states@ filter to return only backups that match the specified state.
--
-- * 'dbNextToken' - The @NextToken@ value that you received in the previous response. Use this value to get more backups.
--
-- * 'dbMaxResults' - The maximum number of backups to return in the response. When there are more backups than the number you specify, the response contains a @NextToken@ value.
