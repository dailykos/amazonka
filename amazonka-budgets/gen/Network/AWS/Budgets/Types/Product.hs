-- | Creates a value of 'Budget' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'bCalculatedSpend' - The actual and forecasted cost or usage that the budget tracks.
--
-- * 'bLastUpdatedTime' - The last time that you updated this budget.
--
-- * 'bBudgetLimit' - The total amount of cost, usage, RI utilization, or RI coverage that you want to track with your budget. @BudgetLimit@ is required for cost or usage budgets, but optional for RI utilization or coverage budgets. RI utilization or coverage budgets default to @100@ , which is the only valid value for RI utilization or coverage budgets.
--
-- * 'bTimePeriod' - The period of time that is covered by a budget. The period has a start date and an end date. The start date must come before the end date. The end date must come before @06/15/87 00:00 UTC@ .  If you create your budget and don't specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose @DAILY@ , and didn't set a start date, AWS set your start date to @01/24/18 00:00 UTC@ . If you chose @MONTHLY@ , AWS set your start date to @01/01/18 00:00 UTC@ . If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end date to @06/15/87 00:00 UTC@ . The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.  You can change either date with the @UpdateBudget@ operation. After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and subscribers.
--
-- * 'bCostTypes' - The types of costs that are included in this @COST@ budget. @USAGE@ , @RI_UTILIZATION@ , and @RI_COVERAGE@ budgets do not have @CostTypes@ .
--
-- * 'bCostFilters' - The cost filters, such as service or region, that are applied to a budget. AWS Budgets supports the following services as a filter for RI budgets:     * Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Compute     * Amazon Redshift     * Amazon Relational Database Service     * Amazon ElastiCache     * Amazon Elasticsearch Service
--
-- * 'bBudgetName' - The name of a budget. The name must be unique within accounts. The @:@ and @\@ characters aren't allowed in @BudgetName@ .
--
-- * 'bTimeUnit' - The length of time until a budget resets the actual and forecasted spend. @DAILY@ is available only for @RI_UTILIZATION@ and @RI_COVERAGE@ budgets.
--
-- * 'bBudgetType' - Whether this budget tracks monetary costs, usage, RI utilization, or RI coverage.
